# In the case of genome assembly not in the chromosome level, i.e. having multiple
# scaffolds, some short scaffolds may be found as entirely composed of TE sequences.
# These scaffolds are entirely masked as 'Xs' by RepeatMasker and subsequently 
# removed using `sed`, resulting in empty sequence under their headers in the fasta 
# file. This causes error when building index using samtools and the following 
# simulation. To solve this problem, this script checks the fasta file and adds two 
# nucleotides randomly to the empty sequences.
